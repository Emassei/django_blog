# This is a boilerplate app to get a django docker app up and running quickly.

## This bare bones app just has:
1. Django Web Server
2. Postgres DB


### Start the project by running the following and entering the required fields.

```
./bootstrap
```

### Add this to the settings file for the postgres db, TODO, add this to the bootstrap script as a sed
```
import os

```
